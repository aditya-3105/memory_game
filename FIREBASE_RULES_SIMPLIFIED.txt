FIRESTORE SECURITY RULES - COPY EXACTLY & PUBLISH

Go to: Firebase Console → Firestore Database → Rules tab
IMPORTANT: Clear all existing content first
Then paste this entire content:

---START COPYING HERE---
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Allow authenticated users to read/write user profiles
    match /users/{uid} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if request.auth.uid == uid;
      
      match /{document=**} {
        allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == uid;
      }
    }

    // Matches collection - allow authenticated users to access
    match /matches/{matchId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
---END COPYING HERE---

CRITICAL STEPS:
1. Go to https://console.firebase.google.com
2. Select project: memory-master-41cca
3. Click "Firestore Database" on left sidebar
4. Click the "Rules" tab
5. DELETE everything in the editor
6. PASTE the above code (from START to END)
7. Click the BLUE "Publish" button at bottom right
8. Wait for "Rules update finished" message
9. Hard refresh your app (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
10. Try PVP again

If still getting permission error after publishing:
- Confirm you're signed in to the app
- Open browser DevTools → Application → Local Storage
- Check if 'memorymaster-settings' exists (means you're logged in)
- Try signing in with email/password or check if auth is working
